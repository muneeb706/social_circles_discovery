# Social Circles Discovery

## Abstract

Online Social Network (OSN) platforms enable users to organize their social circles for managing their contacts. Organizing social circles is a manual task which is not only tedious but unscalable and in-effective as well. Automation of this process would be beneficial for the users to fulfill their social and professional requirements.
Various approaches have been proposed for the automation of this task but none of these approaches takes edge features like trust level between the nodes alongside with other node and structural features into account. In this project, we propose the Node-Edge K-means clustering algorithm to study the importance of individuals with a good reputation in building social circles. Our approach builds on top of the Genetic Algorithm variant of K-means clustering algorithm that considers only node and structural features for discovering social circles. With the help of intrinsic measures, we then evaluate our approach by comparing the quality of social circles discovered after adding the trust level feature with those discovered without this feature.
